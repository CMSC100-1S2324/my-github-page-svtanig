					I am Stephanie Tanig, a Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines - Los Baños, 
					currently in my junior year. My passion for programming has been the driving force behind my academic 
					journey. As a student, I have gained experience in various programming languages, including Python, Java, 
					R, C, and even Assembly language. Beyond the world of code, I have a deep love for three things: film, food, 
					and exploration. Watching movies is my escape, and I relish the storytelling and artistic expression they offer. 
					In my downtime, I often find myself playing mobile games and getting lost in the pages of a good book. Challenges 
					excite me, and I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer and programmer. Whether 
					it's tackling complex coding problems or exploring innovative solutions, I believe that embracing challenges is 
					the key to becoming a skilled and creative problem solver. In the future, I aspire to continue my journey in the 
					world of technology, contributing my skills and passion to meaningful projects. My goal is to not only be a 
					proficient developer but also to make a positive impact through my work.
